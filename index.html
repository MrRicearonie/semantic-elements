                <p>Hello there! I'm Christopher Rempe, and for my first assignment I thought I would introduce myself. I recently
                </br>graduated with a bachelor's in computer science from Western Washington University and am working on my
                </br>next steps in life.</p>

                <p>Photography has become a passion of mine since I started to use my iPhone's camera to take pictures in high school.
                    </br>Since then you'd be hard pressed to find me out on a trail without a camera in my hand. Here are some of my
                    </br>personal favorites from the past 5 1/2 years.</p>

                <p>While going to WWU I discovered that I was more passionate about front-end development than back-end. 
                </br>Sadly, Western did not offer that many front-end classes that counted toward my graduation, so I took it</br>upon myself to learn. 
                    My most recent website is an overhaul of my personal site, which I have embedded</br>below, because why not? 
                    I think that this was the site that I made me want to learn more about the fundementals</br>of website building since I felt like 
                    I was just throwing stuff together to see what worked.</p>
