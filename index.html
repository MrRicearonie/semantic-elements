            <p>Hello there! I'm Christopher Rempe, and for my first assignment I thought I would introduce myself. I recently
            <br>graduated with a bachelor's in computer science from Western Washington University and am working on my
            <br>next steps in life.</p>

                <h3>Photography</h3>
            </header>
            <p>Photography has become a passion of mine since I started to use my iPhone's camera to take pictures in high school.
                <br>Since then you'd be hard pressed to find me out on a trail without a camera in my hand. Here are some of my
                <br>personal favorites from the past 5 1/2 years.</p>

                <h3>Programming</h3>
            </header>
            <p>I've been interested in programming through a friend in junor high, but after a couple of attemps at learning
                <br>(including taking a IDTech week Java bootcamp) it didn't click. That was until I took a required C++ class
                <br>at Western. I was originally going after an EE degree, but everything just clicked in that C++ class and I
                <br>was having a lot of fun programming. After taking a Python class to make sure I really did like, and
                <br>understood what was being taught, I switched my major over to CS. From doing the bomb lab, to creating a
                <br>panorama sticher that made 90's alt rock album covers instead, to coding an operating system's kernel, the
                <br>journey was not easy. And from that journey, I learned that I perfer working on front-end development
                <br>compared to back-end. </p>

                <p>The problem is that Western did not have a lot of classes that was both front-end, and counted towards my
                <br>degree, so I had to teach myself. While I am proud of the websites I have created, I know that most of the
                <br>sites are build on top of a pile of random information from the web I've found, and that I want a strong
                <br>foundation for that pile, hense taking this certification course. I have embedded my latest revision of my
                <br>personal site (<a href="https://crrempe.com">crrempe.com</a>) becasue why not?</p>
